# DH-110-Assignment-07--High-Fidelity-Prototype

# Overview

## Summary

This high fidelity prototype is a redesign of Learning Music Ableton, an electronic music learning website and app. The goal of this app is to make music learning more acessible and easy to use for middle aged men. 

## Process
I used Figma to create this prototype. This design is based off of Learning Music Ableton. After I conducted heauristic evaluations, cognitive walkthroughs, and usability tests, I developed a design that will help with the efficiency and functionality of the website/app. I, then, created a low-fidelity protype to obtain user feedback to work out problem areas and errors in the design and tested the interface design to see if it passed the color contrast ratio for accessibility.

## Purpose

The purpose of a high fidelity prototype is to test the fuctionality of the app. Because middle aged men are the target demographic, all of the usabulity tests, heuristic evaluations, and cognitive wzlkthroughs were conducted with the target demographic in mind. The redesign of the website/app should be more functional and cater to this demographic.
